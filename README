Intune remediation script.

This script removes the currently logged-in user from the device's local Administrators
group, if found.

This script is intended to either be run on-demand from the device page in Intune, or
assigned to a device group and run on a schedule.

detection.ps1 checks for the presence of the current user in the local admin group.
It also checks that the device running it is on a specific domain. Replace the <> text.

remediation.ps1 removes the user from the group. Optionally, it adds a specific user or
group to the local Administrator group before removing the current user from it. Optionally,
it triggers a reboot after running. (substitute for logoff if desired)

Run remediation script with the settings: run in 64-bit shell and run in user's context.
